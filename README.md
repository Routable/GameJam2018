# GameJam2018
You have crash landed on an abandoned island with your arch nemesis. Oh no - they're trying to leave the island without you! Using your wits, and superior intellect, you must gather the appropriate resources and find a way to transmit a distress signal to get help! Island Escape is a resource-based card game. Each turn the player draws two resource cards - rocks, wood, or water. The player must acquire the appropriate amount of resources to build their escape off the island - but watch out, your opponent has their own win condition, and may escape before you. Two of any resource can be traded in to purchase a trap card, which can be used to gain an advantage over your opponent - but be careful, as some cards might not do what you expect them to do!
